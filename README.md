# Team Fortress 2: Launch Base

Team Fortress 2: Launch Base is made for modders who want to create a mod based on the pre-Gold Rush era of TF2. Its goals are to remove the bloat added in and after the Gold Rush update, restore the functionality of old features and bug fixes.

The mod has a code repository too, which can be found [here](https://github.com/WonderlandWar/tf-launch-base-src).

Feel free to contribute to the repository with pull requests.
